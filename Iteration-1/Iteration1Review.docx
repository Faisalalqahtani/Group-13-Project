Group 13

Iteration 1 Review


Task Management and Work Division

The work was divided into three sections, with one group focusing on the database, another on the javascript, and the last group focused on HTML and CSS. However, any one part of the code relied heavily on the other parts, which was being developed by another group. This resulted in inconsistent code and difficulties putting the work of all team together.


Team Meetings and Communication

Meetings were made on average 3 times a week. With one meeting a week being held on Google Hangouts. Many of the meetings were missing members, which caused a significant lack of communication. The Google Hangout meetings tended to have the best attendance since members could attend them anytime.
