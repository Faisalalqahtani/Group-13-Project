Stand up meetings after lecture time
Scheduled meetings
Online meetings
Google hangouts
Facebook group posts and chat

The TA’s has helped steer our group in the right direction by answering questions to clarify ambiguity.
The diversity of knowledge and skills among group members has helped achieve better results since each sub group had certain set of skills or expertise.
