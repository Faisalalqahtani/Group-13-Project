For first iteration:

The application should have basic functionalities:
Register a new user.
Add a drink.
Show selected drinks and their details.

Iteration 1 prof requires:
Iteration plan.
user stories and acceptance tests.
working code.
charts (velocity, burnup, testing).

IMPORTANT: don’t spend too much time on the actual application(coding) which only takes 5% of the final grade. We need to spend more time on the user story or chats which take 40%.

First page: Simple instruction on how do you use the application and the features.
Second page: Profile asking about basic information about users
Main page:	-  A picture to keep track of all drinks and shows the limitation at the same time
		- a button to open a new window(not a new page) to add a new drink.
		- etcccc…
Main goal: keep track of drinks and the nutrition it contains, and analyse the users’ healthy status. (It is said by the TA that we need to keep our user story (function) as simple as possible.)
