Group-13-Project-CSCI3130
=========================

The repository is created one day before the deadline of iteration 1, so there is no process recorded. Our group has been using Google drive to share codes and files since the beginning. The reason is that we thought we can choose either google drive, sky drive, or githup to keep track of our working progress. However, our group has always been working in agile. For more details, please check documentation on google drive.

The code for the web app "Drinking Advisor" are divided into three parts now.
- The first part Registration page provides a fully functional webpage to register a new user and store the information into database for the sake of calculating healthy statistics. It also has JS code to verify whether the form is completed by users.

- The second part Main UI provides a main user interface of the app. It provides a nice interface with some features such as a side navigation bar and some fancy transition effects. The UI is not integrated with JS codes to make it functional yet.

- The third part JS code provides some useful functions in JavaScript to make the app functional. However, it's not integrated with the UI yet.

Codes are written by different members from the group.
